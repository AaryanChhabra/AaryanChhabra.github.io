## Research Experience
**Masters Student @ Sureshkumar Balasubramanian's Lab, Monash University (_May 2023 - April 2024_)**
- This project aimed to identify regulators of splice-site usage.
- [Publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.21.586179v1.abstract)

**Undergraduate Researcher @ Dr Arthur Sherman, Laboratory of Biological Modeling, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (_Dec 2022 -  April 2023_)**
- Metabolic Assessment for Diabetes Screening and Treatment - The project involved exploring models for assessing insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and their product, disposition index. It included testing the suitability of various disposition indices for detecting pre-diabetes and diabetes and developing open-source software in Python.
- [Publication 1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpendo.00189.2023)
- [Publication 2](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgae582/7738986?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

**Undergraduate Researcher @ Laboratory of Mathematical Medicine, IISER Pune., IISER Pune (_Aug 2022 -  Nov 2022_)**
- A Step Towards Capturing Postprandial Hypoglycemic Dip in CGM Data - Involves reinvestigation of the model (using XPPAUT) described in the publication Goel et al., 2018 and an attempt to capture the postprandial hypoglycemic dip.

**Summer Intern @ Dr Utpal Nath's Lab, Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, IISc Bangalore (_May 2022 -  Jul 2022_)**
- Investigation of differentially spliced isoforms in the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants - Involves comparative analysis of splicing variant of mRNA in CIN-TCP mutant with respect to wild type during normal leaf development in Arabidopsis thaliana.
 
**Undergraduate Researcher @ The lab of Regeneration, IISER Pune (_Jan 2022 -  April 2022_)**
- Screening regenerative processes in native plants upon mechanical injury - Involved exploring the leaf vascular regeneration in species with different leaf allometry in response to mechanical disconnection of the mid-vein of a leaf.

**Undergraduate Researcher @ Dr Deepak Barua's Lab, IISER Pune (_Aug 2021 - Nov 2021_)**
- Comparison of the relationship of seed mass with other plant’s functional traits between different parts of Western Ghats, India.
